> <span style="font-size: 20px;">Below are a selection of works I completed during my International Relations BSc at the London School of Economics (2020-2023). The topic of the Change Makers research was an original proposal which the university chose to fund.</span>

### <span style="color: steelblue;">Undergraduate Dissertation - International Tax Avoidance and National Public Concern: A Novel Force within the OECD Project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting.</span> <a href="http://Isaac-Berger-Git.github.io/files/Dissertation.pdf" class="button">[→]</a><span style="color: #808080;">, Data <a href="https://github.com/Isaac-Berger-Git/Isaac-Berger-Git.github.io/blob/master/files/Diss%20Data.xlsx">[→]</a> </span> 

<span style="font-size: 14px;">My thesis offers a twofold contribution to tax avoidance studies. Firstly, public salience is interwoven into the mainstream account of avoidance that prioritises the interaction of large states, low-tax states, multinationals and absent IGOs in the globalised marketplace. Building upon these findings, section two uses original data to evidence how, within OECD BEPS, established societal interests became more influential vis-à-vis multinationals during the wave of saliency from 2012-2016.</span> 


### <span style="color: steelblue;">Change Makers Research - Perceptions of International Waste Management within the International Cohort.</span>      <span style="color: #808080;">Executive Summary <a href="http://Isaac-Berger-Git.github.io/files/Research-Summary.pdf" class="button">[→]</a>, Presentation Slides <a href="http://Isaac-Berger-Git.github.io/files/Research-Presentation.pdf" class="button">[→]</a> </span>  

<span style="font-size: 14px;">This research investigates how international students in London perceive the design of the recycling services in a new country, and whether this affects a tendency to recycle overall. 83 survey responses were gathered, with student opinions measured through Likert-scaled prompts. Results showed it was not international students but those without public recycling prior to university who found recycling less accessible, and that these students came from the UK and abroad.</span>
